# Requirements:
For this assignment I was tasked with making a mobile responsive portfolio for myself utilizing both CSS and Bootstrap.  
# Technologies Used:
### CSS
### Bootstrap
### Javascript
### HTML

# Description:
Making a Portfolio page for myself that is useful for people interested in employing me.   I created three separate pages, with an about me page, a portfolio page, and a contact page.  All three were styled the same and had links via the Navigation Bar to reach the other pages.   Links to all of my social sites - LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, and Github - were included on each page.

# Roadmap
Leaving room to add more to the Profile section of the pages.   Also will link my resume.
